## üìù API Usage

### Movie Endpoints

#### Create a movie

```http
POST /api/movies
```

#### List all movies

```http
GET /api/movies
```

#### Find movie by ID

```http
GET /api/movies/{id}
```

#### Update movie

```http
PUT /api/movies/{id}
```

#### Partial update movie

```http
PATCH /api/movies/{id}
```

#### Delete movie

```http
DELETE /api/movies/{id}
```

### Category Endpoints

#### Create a category

```http
POST /api/categories
```

#### List all categories

```http
GET /api/categories
```

#### Find category by ID

```http
GET /api/categories/{id}
```

### Streaming Platform Endpoints

#### Create a streaming platform

```http
POST /api/platforms
```

#### List all streaming platforms

```http
GET /api/platforms
```

#### Find streaming platform by ID

```http
GET /api/platforms/{id}
```

### Authentication Endpoints

#### Register user

```http
POST /api/auth/register
```

#### Login

```http
POST /api/auth/login
```

#### How to use authentication token

For protected endpoints, include the JWT token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

#### Security Implementation

The API uses Spring Security with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication:

- **Token-based Authentication**: All protected endpoints require a valid JWT token
- **Token Duration**: Tokens expire after 24 hours by default
- **Password Storage**: Passwords are stored using BCrypt hashing algorithm
- **CORS Configuration**: API has proper CORS settings for web clients
- **Role-based Authorization**: Different endpoints require different roles (ADMIN, USER)

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Structure

The system uses Flyway migrations to create and update the database structure. The main tables include:

- `tb_movies`: Stores movie information
- `tb_categories`: Stores category information
- `tb_platforms`: Stores streaming platform information
- `tb_movies_categories`: Join table for movies and categories
- `tb_movies_platforms`: Join table for movies and platforms
- `tb_users`: Stores user information for authentication

## üìö API Documentation

Complete API documentation is available through Swagger UI, accessible after starting the application:
